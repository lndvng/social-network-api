# social-network-api

## Description
The motive behind this project was to build an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friends’ thoughts, and create a friend list. I learned how to create models and implement CRUD through mongoose, and I also learned how to make GET/POST/PUT/DELETE requests using Insomnia.
